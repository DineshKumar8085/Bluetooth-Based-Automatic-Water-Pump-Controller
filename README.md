# Bluetooth-Based-Automatic-Water-Pump-Controller
The Bluetooth-based automatic water pump controller is a system designed to automate the process of controlling the water pump. This system is designed to operate the water pump usingBluetooth technology, which is widely available on smartphones and other mobile devices. The system is based on a microcontroller and a Bluetooth module that receives commands from a mobile application. The application sends the on/off commands and the duration of the water pump operation to the controller, which in turn activates the water pump. The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to operate, requiring minimal technical knowledge. The system eliminates the need for manual control and provides automatic control over the water pump, which saves time and energy. The system can be used in various applications, including irrigation systems, water supply systems, and industrial applications.
